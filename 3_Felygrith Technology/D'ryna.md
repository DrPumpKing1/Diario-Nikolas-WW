#ale 

Vyrx seems skeptical to use it, I suppose another zurryth "restriction" makes her doubt to even use this, I can just guess that it´s because this object seems to suck all the K'aerum from its font, making it completely useless. Still, if it´s so forbidden for the Zurryth...Why can they use it?
