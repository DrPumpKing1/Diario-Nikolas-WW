We entered a room with the presence of various recipients of various shapes containing some compounds that seem to have lost his reactive shining compound some time ago. As we wander cautiously through this laboratory Vyrx told me that this was a Healers room, an invention of the Rathika and the Xotark for creating medication to the four races, especially the Xotark and Vythanu who had shorter lives.

I saw some kind of safe box and locked drawers, maybe to keep the medications safe from thieves or other kinds of banditry. Vyrx told me that some Zurrtyh saw as wrong the medication crafting, due to the use of sacred natural plants. 

Over a table was a mortar with pulp from a crushed plant. Vyrx quickly identified that as a medicine that they some time ago gave her when she was little.
