There was this room, in the Spiritual Knowledge center that resembles a library. There was lots shelves, some of there fallen in the ground, with ancient scrolls that the mutt helped me translating, for some reason. In the scrolls were myths and stories from the four tribes. It could be hear the difference in writing from every race of the Felygrith. The Xotark scrolls were more similar to investigations, Zurryth ones were like fables that taught the dominance of his goddess and the superiority of his race through moral lessons, Rathika had every day life stories and epic tales and Vythanu had things that resembles financial receipts.

There was two big tablets, some Ancient Rathika writings, in the room with a special writing. According to Vyrx, there was a fictional history and child nonsense, but I suspect that she's lying to me, since she was very upset when she read it.
