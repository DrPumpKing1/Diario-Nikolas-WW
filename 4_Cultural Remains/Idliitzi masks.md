I've seen catacombs before, but this place is more than a graveyard, it's a celebration of the afterlife, if that even makes sense.

I can almost hear my own footsteps with how vast and empty feels, there aren´t many bodies in here, and the few of them had masks on top, that caught my attention..they’re hard to describe, though the closest thing I can compare them to are the tribal african masks I have seen once in one of my travels decades ago.

Each mask is crafted in the likeness of a lion’s face, with eyes that seem to convey emotion, that's what makes it even stranger, they aren’t haunting, though. Instead, they seem… joyous. 

Vyrx it's kind of quiet now, she´s obviously not a fan of the Rathika´s openness about death and how they view everything positively, however, it’s more than just discomfort. There’s something else in her tone, a bitterness she’s trying to mask. I can see it in the way she moves, in her restrained words. She acts like she’s dismissive, but there’s a hint of… jealousy. Like part of her wishes her people, the Zurryth, could take life and embrace death the same way.
