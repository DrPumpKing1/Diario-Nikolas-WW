#salva

Searching the chambers of every race I stumble in this strange burial. There were inscripted tablets all over the place, some broken, some well preserved. Vyrx said that these are the Ponstaky tablets of the Xotark. Since young, the Xotark kittens write down every life achievement they make in their own tablets.

There was a big one in the room, with lots of achievements. We got close to writing about who the tablet was: Rasa, the inventor of K'aerum. I also noticed there were lots of empty tablets with names on it. Vyrx told me that only young Xotark are forgiven for not fulfilling their Ponstaky tablets, then I understood it.
