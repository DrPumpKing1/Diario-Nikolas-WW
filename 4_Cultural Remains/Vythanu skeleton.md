I feel strange, normally I am used to corpses, especially bones, they don't look gruesome to my eyes, many kills, many dead people and mutts, but…for some reason seeing that tiny skeleton regressed me in time, it felt like when I found my kitten's small body, lifeless on the floor, and how Janet and I had to bury him. That day hit me hard, more than I let myself admit at the time.  

Now, looking at these remains, the memories flood back. The bones are small, fragile, like they belonged to something that didn’t stand a chance out here. 

Vyrx is different lately. There's no disdain, no sharp judgment like there used to be. Instead, there's a quiet sadness in her eyes, a weight she carries but doesn't talk about. She sees their skeletal remains, their hollow devotion to her so-called "savior" and I think it’s starting to get to her.
