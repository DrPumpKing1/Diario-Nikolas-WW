#ale 

I entered an excessively large room, much larger than other areas of this place, the ceiling is very high, and the width not even worth mentioning it. This place looks like some kind of sacred initiation room or something like that, as such a size can only mean that this is where the people who used to wander around this temple used to gather.

I found a regular sized amulet with some kind of crystal in the centre, it doesn't look so special at first sight but, based on the reaction and that comment from the mutt, I can assume it is something special, maybe like in those tribes where they look for something material to show the others the recognition of their authorities.
