I thought that the hall of statues was already an extreme display of these felines' devotion to their goddess, but no, this place has an even higher ceiling and the presence of this statue is much more impressive, it reminds me of the sphinxes of ancient Egypt, a place I once visited in my youth.

That figure that haunts me every step I take in this temple finally has a name, not titles that others give it, but the original name, Katryss. The love for her is a bit excessive for me, but well, all deities are worshiped in excess, from the most pacifist to the most aggressive.

Sometimes I can't understand a single word of what that cat is talking about, I can only assume things, like that I feel her invaded by a sense of nostalgia and... abnegation?
