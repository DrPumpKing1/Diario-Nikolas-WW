We went deep into a hall full statues. The roof was almost two times higher the rest of the sanctuary and most of the statues were tall enough to almost reach to the roof of the hall. There was a lot of space around to focus in the art and the natural light filtering through ornamented holes and some other cracks in the room bathed the details of each statue highlighting the passage of time and decay that went through the ancient temple.

The statue that I give the most attention was a broken one, but it clearly seems that it wasn't a natural o accidental destruction, but an intended one. A statue that seems to have symbolized the union of 4 races around a divine figure, but broken is just a remainder of how nothing lasts forever, even if it seems holy or divine.

Vyrx, my alien feline companion, was unusually quiet around the statue, almost as if she was trying to hide the shame of her belief, but maybe it was just me.
