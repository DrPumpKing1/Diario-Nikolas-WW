The first thing I see when I enter this place is a painting of an ‘’important‘’ feline being, which shares certain features with that strange mutant I just met, but this one has fur on her entire body that is a pearly colour, she doesn't have a hole in her forehead, her eyes are white, that makes me think she's definitely the best specimen of her breed.

Vyrx, or whatever her name is, is too uptight, her fanaticism extremely evident. I can definitely tell this one on the painting is some sort of deity. But...Felines worshiping a cat goddess? It's something I would only have imagined in children's stories.
