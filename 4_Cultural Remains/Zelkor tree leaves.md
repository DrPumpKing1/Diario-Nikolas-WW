We enter a colorful floral burial chamber. There were fewer gravestones than in the other 3 races chambers, but were better adorned. I noticed big leaves that reminded me of the Garden of offerings. Vyrx said that they were from the sacred Zelkor tree. As the Zurryth live long lives, the Zelkor tree leaves are a sign of their longevity.
