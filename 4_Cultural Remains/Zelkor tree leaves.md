We enter a colorful floral burial chamber. Here were fewer gravestones than in the other 3 races chambers, but were better adorned. I noticed big leaves that reminded me from the Garden of offerings. Vyrx told that were from the sacred Zelkor tree. As the Zurryth live long lifes, the Zelkor tree leaves are a sign of their longevity.
