This room didn't look like anything out of the ordinary, just bookshelves with half-broken stones, others scattered around, but nothing more strange than the glitter which decorates parts of it, or so I thought.

Vyrx, she's very very tense and scared for some reason, she said she heard crying and screaming, obviously I don't hear anything and I can't prove it, but, it seems that those stones contain souls or something like that, the weird thing is that only she hears them crying and screaming, possibly another exclusive Zurryth ability, as if they didn't have enough of them.
