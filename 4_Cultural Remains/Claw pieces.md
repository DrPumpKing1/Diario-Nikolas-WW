As I enter this room, hidden with shame in the Spiritual Knowledge center, I could hear the screaming voices and cries of children. Vyrx was more receptive than me. She enter reluctantly to the room.

Inside, it seems like a destroyed nursery, Vyrx told me it was the storyteller room, where the children from the four races gathered to hear stories from her goddess, but when the conflict between these started, it was massacred.

I approached to the claws of some felygrith pinned over a shelf. Vyrx was breathing so hard, full of anger. I suppose one of them belonged to a Zurryth. I kept the claws with me, in case I need to do further studies on them.
