#salva

Even before entering the room that Vyrx refers as Offerings room, I could see and smell the vegetal overgrowth of an strong vital force. Once I enter, leaves, and jungle like vines blocked my field of vision and hindered my movement. The room wasn't large enough to feel lost, but all the leaves, roots and crops around make me felt like where treasuring something worth of seeing. And thus, in a corner of the room, there was a pile of orange glowing big seeds.

I didn't felt any danger coming from the seeds, but Vyrx told me that these were sacred offerings made to her godess and we should retreat. With the frustrated intention of taking a seed for myself I returned from the room. Or so I did?
