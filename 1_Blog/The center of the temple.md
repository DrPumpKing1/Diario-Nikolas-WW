We finally arrived to the center of the temple after a long and kind of weird introduction to an alien culture and technology. Vyrx told me this used to be a point of reunion between the 4 alien races, so its name "Chamber of Cultural Passages". Yet it seems more like the frontier between four nations than a place of exchange between members of each tribe. But, as the whole temple, this deserted place is just a shadow from the time when it use to shine.
