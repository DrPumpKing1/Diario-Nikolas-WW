We needed to collect the shield from the Xotark next. In total, four shields are needed to be worthy of the Kahoshita's soul, as Vyrx told me. Since it leads me to the relic, it's worth the risk I suppose.

We enter the Spiritual Knowledge center, it seemed like a very dark place as the light was weaker than in previous areas. The Xotark are accredited as the inventors of K'aerum, so this dark knowledge is possibly entangled with the core itself of the temple.
