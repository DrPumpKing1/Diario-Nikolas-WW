Nikolas Watson - Mission “Katzilonhys”: Day 1 

I finally set foot on this forsaken rock of a planet called Aesyth. Located in Galaxy GN-z11… deep enough in the void that even us, the “reckless” Vultures of the Void barely have charts for it. I can’t believe they even bothered naming this place. Feels like the kind of planet you land on by accident… or desperation. Guess that makes me desperate… and also very stupid.

It's almost funny, my gear is mostly old or broken, and my pistol is fried beyond repair, but I can't even think of even tossing it away in this damn place.

I am without anyone and anything, in my old days I would have loved this, but now, even my back feels the consequences of it, but it doesn't matter. Once I get in and out of that temple, with that stupid relic, it will be worth it, all of it.
