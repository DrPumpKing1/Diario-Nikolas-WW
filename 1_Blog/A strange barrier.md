I though the Sanctuary didn't had anything more to offer but as I went inside the Rathika side of the temple I discover curious things, as the old times.

We solve the cable's puzzle and right after that we stumble with a strange ethereum K'aerum barrier. It didn't let us go to the other side, and it didn't seem to let pass K'aerum either.

After some exploration we found the mechanism that powered the barrier and disable it.
