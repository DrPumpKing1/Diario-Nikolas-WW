I though the Temple didn't had anything more to offer but as I went inside the Vythanu side of the temple I discover curious things, as the old times.

We solve the peashooters puzzle and right after that we stumble with a strange  K'aerum barrier. It didn't let us go to the other side, and it didn't seem to let pass K'aerum either.

After some exploration we found the mechanism that powered the barrier and disable it.
