Vyrx and I entered the Sanctuary of Kahoshita from the Rathika. I'm still puzzled about how this electricity alike technology called K'aerum. It seem to flow from the green boxes through the cable like C'ibla to lots of devices inside the temple. 

We faced an complicated puzzle where we had to fill the holes in some kind of K'aerum circuit to connect the K'aerum sources to the right gadgets that let us pass to the learning room. There were cables that lead to nothing, maybe they fell from the roof of the temple after the decay of the structure and disconnected from other devices.

I asked Vyrx, she told me that the K'aerum is alive, an thus after long of time, it seems to be attracted the Zelkor tree seeds from the Garden of offerings and scaped from the source in the previous room with the pass of time taking the shape of cables in the process.
