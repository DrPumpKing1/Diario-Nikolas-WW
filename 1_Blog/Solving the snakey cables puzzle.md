The cat and I entered the Sanctuary of Kahoshita from the Rathika. I'm still puzzled about how this electricity-like technology is called K'aerum. It seems to flow from the green boxes through the cable like C'ibla to lots of devices inside the temple.Â 

We faced a complicated puzzle where we had to fill the holes in some kind of K'aerum circuit to connect the K'aerum sources to the right gadgets that let us pass to the learning room. There were cables that led to nothing; maybe they fell from the roof of the temple after the decay of the structure and disconnected from other devices.

I asked her, and she told me that the K'aerum is alive, and thus, after a long time, it seems to have attracted the Zelkor tree seeds from the Garden of Offerings and escaped from the source in the previous room with the passage of time, taking the shape of cables in the process.
