This new artifact that Vyrx learned in the previous sector seemed very interesting. It was a way to make K'aerum reach larger distances through the air. But, if it worked better than the cables why it isn't in the previous places. Didn't want to ask Vyrx as it seemed touched by the findings of this journey, but from the attitude Vyrx had, and the nature of the Xotark, it looks like this artifact was some kind of dark knowledge, maybe vetoed from existence by the Zurryth, treasured by the Xotark and stealed by the Vythanu as they seemed to covet the treasures from others. As the Vythanu couldn't understand it well, there was a big puzzle from the Vythanu area that was extremely hard to solve.
