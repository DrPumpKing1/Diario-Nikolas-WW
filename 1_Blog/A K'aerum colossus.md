We seemed to be reaching the Katryss' mausoleum when we saw another of the strange portals. The puzzle in here was a lot different from the other transdimensional puzzles. It looked like it was preparing for something big. And as I thought, there was a big K'aerum golem we needed to face before reaching the bounty.

The battle was hard, but we are not blind to its abilities and we defeated it. Hopefully it doesnÂ´t give us farther consequences.
