We seemed to be reaching the Katryss' mausoleum when we saw another of the quirky portals. The puzzle in here was a lot different from the other trans dimensional puzzles. It looked like it was preparing to something big. And as I though, there was big K'aerum golem we needed to face before reaching the bounty.

The battle was hard, but with our understanding of K'aerum, we stand victorious.
