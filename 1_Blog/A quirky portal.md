#salva

I though the Sanctuary didn't had anything more to offer but as I went inside the Rathika side of the temple I discover curious things, as the old times.

The puzzle was solved and Vyrx acquired a new power, but when we were about to leave the learning area the floor broke and a kind of green portal emerged from the abysm. I was cautious about this portal, but Vyrx extended her hand and when she reach it, we were transported to some nebolous dreamlike dimension.

This dimension had a puzzle of K'aerum, but it use some different elements from the usuals. Two barries that divide the puzzle. Even if it seemed like a translucent projection it was solid as the steel from my spaceship.

Finally, we left the room with another portal, and with some dimensional nausea.
