#salva 

---

I thought the sanctuary didn't have anything more to offer, but as I went inside the Rathika side of the temple, I discovered curious things, as in the old times.

The puzzle was solved, and Vyrx acquired a new power, but when we were about to leave the learning area, the floor broke and a kind of green portal emerged from the abysm. I was cautious about this portal, but Vyrx extended her hand, and when she reached it, we were transported to some nebulous dreamlike dimension.

This dimension had a puzzle of K'aerum, but it used some different elements from the usuals. Two bars that divide the puzzle. Even if it seemed like a translucent projection, it was as solid as the steel from my spaceship.

Finally, we left the room with another portal and with some dimensional nausea.
