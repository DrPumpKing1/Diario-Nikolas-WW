There is something very wrong with her, there is no doubt about it. I can see the little fur on her body prickling and her breathing seems out of control even though she tries to hide it from me.

The voices of her ancestors were definitely not gentle with her...and for the first time she is not bragging about the pride that is her race, but I see her looking different, I would even say more broken.
