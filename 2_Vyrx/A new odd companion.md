I never thought I'd find a local one, and I didn't want to.

Vyrx (that´s the name she told me) has physique is similar to those previously known as "Felis Catus" from planet Earth; those simple domestic cats, now extinct for centuries, had an innocence to them, but this one, even if she has the same movements, expressions, and elegance, something´s off. Those eyes and that strange way of communicating, that pierces my head with the feeling of freezing water on my brain, remind me of the reality of things.

She needs something. She’s sizing me up, calculating, and trying to figure out how to convince me and how to use me. She naively seeks my help, almost as if she believes I’m her best chance. But I’ve seen it too many times; it's all lies.
